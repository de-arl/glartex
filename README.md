=== GLARTEX VERSION 0.4 ===

Glartex is a commandline utility to edit latex-Documents with your favorite editor and your favorite pdf-viewer.
 
This enables latex editing with the programms you are most productive with, or editing latex in pure wayland sessions.

Glartex will open all the programms you need for your latex-session and it will watch the tex-file you edit: Everytime the file is changed, it will be compiled.

Glartex supports latex, bibtex, synctex and it has built-in functions to invoke a translation shell or move windows to your preffered workspaces if you use sway.


INSTALLATION:

Install entr (eradman.com/entrproject/)

If you want to use the translate option install the translate shell (soimort.org/translate/shell/)

Copy glartex_v0.4 to ~/.config/glartex

Add ./config/glartex/scripts to your PATH or copy the executables into your PATH

To get forward and backward search with vim or gvim and zathura run the install script in glartex/install_zathura_vim_synctex
